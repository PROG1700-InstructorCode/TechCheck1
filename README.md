## PROG1700- Logic and Programming
Restaurant Bill
You will create a console-based JavaScript program that will calculate the amount of the tip, the tax, and the total amount of a restaurant bill. The program will prompt the user to input the original amount of the bill. The program will then output the amount of the tax (15% of the original amount) and a tip (20% of the original amount). Finally, the program will output the new total of the bill.
You do not need to worry about decimal places and currency formatting (i.e. a dollar sign) in the output. Output like the samples at the end of this document is perfectly fine at this point. Your tip should not include the tax amount.
Suggested Steps
1. Study the sample output screenshots, to understand what the completed program should look like.
2. Assign the value 85 to the variable bill (i.e. hard-code the bill variable).
3. Assign a variable tax to the value of 15% of the variable bill.
4. Assign a variable tip to the value of 20% of the variable bill.
5. Assign a variable total to the sum of the variables: bill, tip, and tax.
6. Display the value of bill in the console window.
7. Display the value of tax in the console window.
8. Display the value of tip in the console window.
9. Display the value of total in the console window.
10. Comment out the hard-coded bill variable, & change the code to allow the user to input the original bill amount.
